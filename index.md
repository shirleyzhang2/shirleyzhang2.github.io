## About Me

I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto pursuing a major in Civil Engineering and a minor in Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I am working part-time as a structural engineering intern while completing my last year of studies. 

Since 2018, I have been conducting research with [Prof. Oya Mercan](https://civmin.utoronto.ca/home/about-us/directory/professors/oya-mercan/) on seismic hazard mitigation for large Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) storage tanks. For my fourth-year capstone project, I am designing a ML-based predictive maintenance algorithm for HVAC systems under the supervision of [Prof. Markus Bussmann](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/bussmann/) and [Prof. Seungjae Lee](https://civmin.utoronto.ca/home/about-us/directory/professors/seungjae-lee/). I am also writing an undergraduate thesis on Automatic Drill-core Logging using Core Imagery under the supervision of [Prof. Sebastian Goodfellow](https://civmin.utoronto.ca/home/about-us/directory/professors/sebastian-goodfellow/).

Outside of school, I have over 20 months of industry internship experience in the structural consulting, software, and nuclear sector. In 2019, I worked as a geotechnical software developer to propose and implement computational methods for settlement under seismic loading. In 2020, I worked as a structural engineer to design stiffening and dampening devices that mitigated a crowd-induced floor vibration problem at Ohio State University. From 2020 to 2021, I designed structural systems for the next generation of Small Modular Reactors and conducted research on aircraft impact analysis.

My interests lie at the intersection of infrastructure and technology, and I hope to improve the efficiency and resilience of critical infrastructure systems using computational and data-driven techniques.
