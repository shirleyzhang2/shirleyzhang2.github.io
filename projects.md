## Aircraft Impact Analysis
### 2020.9 - present

During my ongoing internship at [Terrestrial Energy](https://www.terrestrialenergy.com/), I helped design nuclear buildings and reactor support structures for Integral Molten Salt Reactors (IMSR). Apart from preliminary structural design and seismic analysis, I also worked on the research and development of aircraft impact analysis methodologies which I presented at the  [2021 Women in Nuclear Global Conference](https://womeninnuclear.com/news-events/events/2021-women-in-nuclear-global-conference/).

## Real-Time Mask Detection
### 2021.5 - 2021.8

For my Applied Fundamentals of Machine Learning course, I developed a real-time face mask detection model using the SSD-MobileNetV2 architecture. The model automades the screening process for mask mandates by not only identifying whether a mask is worn properly, but also classifying the type of mask being worn. In a group of 4, we also implemented the detection model as an iOS application to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance in actual use cases.

## Bikeshare Usage Prediction
### 2021.5 - 2021.8

For my Data Science for Civil Engineers course, I worked with 2 other students to analyze bike-share data in Toronto from 2017 to 2020. We performed data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and modelling to predict hourly ridership demand. We then used the insights from historic data to inform the feasibility of expanding the bike-share program in the future.



## DesignCheck
### 2020.6 - 2020.7

During my summer internship at [Arup](https://www.arup.com/), I contributed to [DesignCheck](https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Dynamo-Engineers-Design-All-2018), a C# platform that performs user-defined engineering calculations and creates formatted reports via dynamically generated web APIs. By building a centralized hub of calculations to iterate and control design processes, DesignCheck helps inform, improve, and accelerate project delivery.

## Settle3
### 2019.5 - 2019.8

During my summer internship at [Rocscience](https://www.rocscience.com/), I developed <a href=".\docs\pdf\Settle3_update.pdf">ground improvement and settlement calculation features</a> for a 3D Soil Analysis Software called [Settle3](https://www.rocscience.com/software/settle3) using C++. My contributions involved literary review, backend development, user interface design, and documentation.


## Autobuilder
### 2019.5 - 2021.4

As a co-captain for the [UofT Seismic Design Team](http://seismic.skule.ca/), I worked with 3 other members to develop "Autobuilder", an in-house Python program with a Qt interface that can automatically create thousands of design iterations based on user-defined constraints. By removing repetition in manual modelling efforts and accelerating project delivery, Autobuilder helped us achieve 6th place out of 46 international teams at the [2020 Undergraduate Seismic Design Competition](https://slc.eeri.org/2020-seismic-design-competition/).

## Canoe Design
### 2018.9 - 2021.5

As the technical director for the [UofT Concrete Canoe Team](https://canoe.skule.ca/), I leveraged MATLAB to determine the levels of stress experienced by the canoe in a variety of static and dynamic loading cases such as construction, transport, and paddling.  I also helped develop a C++ program that optimizes hull geometry by balancing maneuverability and fluid resistance. In 2019, our team won 4th place at the [Canadian National Concrete Canoe Competition](https://www.cscecompetitions.ca/en/home/cnccc/).
