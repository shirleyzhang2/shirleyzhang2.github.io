During my 1-year internship at [Terrestrial Energy](https://www.terrestrialenergy.com/), I helped design nuclear buildings and reactor support structures for Integral Molten Salt Reactors (IMSR). I focused on the research and development of aircraft impact analysis and submitted an oral presentation to the [2021 Women in Nuclear Global Conference](https://womeninnuclear.com/news-events/events/2021-women-in-nuclear-global-conference/).

## DesignCheck
### 2020.7 - 2020.8

During my summer internship at [Arup](https://www.arup.com/), I contributed to [DesignCheck](https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Dynamo-Engineers-Design-All-2018), a C# platform that performs user-defined engineering calculations and creates formatted reports via dynamically generated web APIs. By building a centralized hub of calculations to iterate and control design processes, DesignCheck helps inform, improve, and accelerate project delivery.

## Settle3
### 2019.5 - 2019.8

During my summer internship at [Rocscience](https://www.rocscience.com/), I developed <a href=".\docs\pdf\Settle3_update.pdf">ground improvement and settlement calculation features</a> for a 3D Soil Analysis Software called [Settle3](https://www.rocscience.com/software/settle3) using C++. My contributions involved literary review, backend development, user interface design, and documentation.


## Autobuilder

As a co-captain for the [UofT Seismic Design Team](http://seismic.skule.ca/), I worked with 3 other members to develop "Autobuilder", an in-house Python program with a Qt interface that can automatically create thousands of design iterations based on user-defined constraints. By removing repetition in manual modelling efforts and accelerating project delivery, Autobuilder helped us achieve 6th place out of 46 international teams at the [2020 Undergraduate Seismic Design Competition](https://slc.eeri.org/2020-seismic-design-competition/).

## Canoe Design
### 2018.9 - present

As the technical director for the [UofT Concrete Canoe Team](https://canoe.skule.ca/), I leveraged MATLAB to determine the levels of stress experienced by the canoe in a variety of static and dynamic loading cases such as construction, transport, and paddling.  I also helped develop a C++ program that optimizes hull geometry by balancing maneuverability and fluid resistance. In 2019, our team won 4th place at the [Canadian National Concrete Canoe Competition](https://www.cscecompetitions.ca/en/home/cnccc/).
