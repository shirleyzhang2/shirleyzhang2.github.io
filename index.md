## Introduction

I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto pursuing a major in Civil Engineering and a minor in Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I am working part-time in the nuclear sector as a structural engineering intern while completing my last year of studies. 

Since 2018, I have been conducting research with [Prof. Oya Mercan](https://civmin.utoronto.ca/home/about-us/directory/professors/oya-mercan/) on seismic hazard mitigation for large Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) storage tanks. For my fourth-year capstone project, I am designing and building a ML-based analytics platform to perform predictive maintenance for HVAC and Controls systems under the supervision of [Prof. Markus Bussmann](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/bussmann/) and [Prof. Seungjae Lee](https://civmin.utoronto.ca/home/about-us/directory/professors/seungjae-lee/). I am also writing an undergraduate thesis on Automatic Drill-core Logging using Core Imagery under the supervision of [Prof. Sebastian Goodfellow](https://civmin.utoronto.ca/home/about-us/directory/professors/sebastian-goodfellow/). 

My research interest lies at the intersection of infrastructure and technology, and I hope to improve the efficiency and resilience of critical infrastructure systems using computational and data science techniques.
