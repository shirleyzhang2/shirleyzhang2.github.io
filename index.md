## About Me

I am a graudate student at Stanford University pursuing a Master of Science degree in [Sustainable Urban Systems](https://cee.stanford.edu/academics-admission/graduate-degrees/ms-programs/sustainable-design-construction-sdc#SDCSUS). I previously graduated from the University of Toronto with a major in Civil Engineering and a minor in Artificial Intelligence Engineering. Currently, I am working as a Data Science Engineering intern for the [Energy Operations department](https://lbre.stanford.edu/sem/what-we-do/campus-energy-operations) on campus.

Prior to graduate school, I had close to 3 years of industry internship experience in structural engineering and software development. In 2019, I worked at [Rocscience](https://www.rocscience.com/) as a geotechnical software developer to propose and implement computational methods for soil settlement under seismic loading. In 2020, I worked at [Arup](https://www.arup.com/) as a structural engineering intern to design stiffening and dampening devices that mitigated a crowd-induced floor vibration problem at Ohio State University. I also contributed to a web-based platform that controls iterative design processes through a centralized hub of engineering calculations. From 2020 to 2022, I helped design structural systems for the next generation of Small Modular Reactors at [Terrestrial Energy](https://www.terrestrialenergy.com/) and developed automation scripts for aircraft impact analysis, which I presented at the [Women in Nuclear Global Conference](https://win-global.org/activities/annual).

From 2018 to 2022, I conducted research with [Prof. Oya Mercan](https://civmin.utoronto.ca/home/about-us/directory/professors/oya-mercan/) on seismic hazard mitigation for large Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) storage tanks. For my senior capstone project, I worked with [Modern Niagara Group](https://modernniagara.com/) to develop a ML-based predictive maintenance algorithm for HVAC systems. I also wrote an undergraduate thesis on Automatic Drill-core Logging using Deep Learning in collaboration with [Kore Geosystems](https://www.koregeosystems.com/). In addition, I held executive roles in several student design teams on campus and developed multiple in-house software that helped us place in the top 3 at national and international competitions.

My interests lie at the intersection of infrastructure and technology, and I hope to improve the efficiency and resilience of urban infrastructure systems using computational and data-driven techniques.
